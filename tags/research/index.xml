      <description>This webpage contains documents that I generated, like the Isabelle documentation from my PhD thesis. This is the only way to have links which survives changes in my affiliation.
For my publications, please look here; for my academic duties, please look here.
Research SAT Solver Framework isasatCDCL As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expend it. It is not a very fast SAT solver, but you are guaranteed that the answer is correct and that there is no overflow happening internally that would compromise correctness.</description>

      <description>Here the release of my projects that I manage myself (so unlike my changes to, e.g., CaDiCaL).
IsaSAT 2021: EDA Challenge This the first official release of the IsaSAT in LLVM IR. See the sources and the system description submitted at the EDA Challenge for a list of changes compared to IsaSAT in Standard ML.
The main difference compared to the Standard ML version developped in my PhD is that the Isabelle theorem is now incomplete (this was implicit earlier in the sense that it is a limit of the compiler, not a limit of the program) and that the new version is much faster.</description>
