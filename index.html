				<p>SAT Competition 2024 There is not much to tell for the release for this year of the SAT Competition 2024. This year, I finished last, exactly as expected. However, I am very close to the second-to-last on SAT benchmarks.
My main performance problem seems to be UNSAT problems, which I blame on missing preprocessing. I intended to implement variable elimination based on the model reconstruction implemented in Katharina Wagner&rsquo;s Master&rsquo;s thesis in Isabelle. I actually started to implement it, but, as usual, once I went to proofs, things became more complicated. But it is interesting.

				<p>This webpage contains documents that I generated, like the Isabelle documentation from my PhD thesis. This is the only way to have links which survives changes in my affiliation.
For my publications, please look here; for my academic duties, please look here.
Research SAT Solver Framework isasatCDCL As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expend it. It is not a very fast SAT solver, but you are guaranteed that the answer is correct and that there is no overflow happening internally that would compromise correctness.

				<p>Here the release of my projects that I manage myself (so unlike my changes to, e.g., CaDiCaL).
IsaSAT 2021: EDA Challenge This the first official release of the IsaSAT in LLVM IR. See the sources and the system description submitted at the EDA Challenge for a list of changes compared to IsaSAT in Standard ML.
The main difference compared to the Standard ML version developped in my PhD is that the Isabelle theorem is now incomplete (this was implicit earlier in the sense that it is a limit of the compiler, not a limit of the program) and that the new version is much faster.

				<p>IsaSAT is one of the few verified SAT solvers (and to my knowledge the only one that is currently maintained). It is verified in Isabelle using the Isabelle Refinement Framework by synthesizing code. See the presentation for more details.

				<p>As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expand it. The general organization is given by the following graph: . If you want to have a look at the sources, look at the IsaFoL repository (this is the latest bleeding age version, so it is sometimes broken) and the Isabelle-generated HTML documentation (look at the &ldquo;IsaFoL&rdquo; version at the bottom to know the corresponding git ID).
