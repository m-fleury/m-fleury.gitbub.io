				<p>This webpage contains documents that I generated, like the Isabelle documentation from my PhD thesis. This is the only way to have links which survives changes in my affiliation.
For my publications, please look here; for my academic duties, please look here.
Research SAT Solver Framework As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expend it. It is not a very fast SAT solver, but you are guaranteed that the answer is correct and that there is no overflow happening internally that would compromise correctness.  … </p>

				<p>Here the release of my projects that I manage myself (so unlike my changes to, e.g., CaDiCaL).
IsaSAT 2021: EDA Challenge This the first official release of the IsaSAT in LLVM IR. See the sources and the system description submitted at the EDA Challenge for a list of changes compared to IsaSAT in Standard ML.
The main difference compared to the Standard ML version developped in my PhD is that the Isabelle theorem is now incomplete (this was implicit earlie) and that the new version is much faster.  … </p>

				<p>IsaSAT is one of the few verified SAT solvers (and to my knowledge the only one that is currently maintained). It is verified in Isabelle using the Isabelle Refinement Framework by synthesizing code. See the presentation for more details. </p>

				<p>As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expand it. The general organization is given by the following graph: . If you want to have a look at the sources, look at the IsaFoL repository (this is the latest bleeding age version, so it is sometimes broken) and the Isabelle-generated HTML documentation (look at the &ldquo;IsaFoL&rdquo; version at the bottom to know the corresponding git ID).  … </p>

				<p>EDA-Challenge 2021 The first official release is available. It is the version submitted to the EDA-Challenge 2021. To the surprise of everyone (including the author!), it actually won the challenge. The system description submitted to the EDA Challenge is available.
How good is the solver really? Another comparison is the well-known SAT Competition that features hard instances with long running time. The comparison is unfair towards my SAT solver (because you need inprocessing nowadays to even have a chance for most instances), but the SAT Competition is the standard way to compare solvers.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>While I don&rsquo;t understand much algebra, I know Isabelle and implemented a checker in Isabelle/HOL. I used the Refinement Framework and Sepref to generated code in Standard ML. The code is mostly functional (except for the hashmap that is synthesized automatically by Sepref &ndash; no need to understand and know anything about it!).
How does Pastèque work? I started with an abstract calculus that models the rules of the proofs system.  … </p>
