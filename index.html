				<p>SAT Competition 2023 This year, once again, I submitted IsaSAT to the SAT Competition 2023 (the source code is as always available). According to the results, I did not finish last. However, compared to other solvers, I am trailing in the unsatisfiable instances. I believe that this is due to the fact that I still do not have bounded variable elimination. In the past, I assumed that vivification was also very important, but its importance is now less clear after Daniela and I attempted to examine it more precisely for POS'23 on the SAT solver CaDiCaL.  … </p>

For my publications, please look here; for my academic duties, please look here.
Research SAT Solver Framework isasatCDCL As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expend it. It is not a very fast SAT solver, but you are guaranteed that the answer is correct and that there is no overflow happening internally that would compromise correctness.  … </p>

				<p>Here the release of my projects that I manage myself (so unlike my changes to, e.g., CaDiCaL).
IsaSAT 2021: EDA Challenge This the first official release of the IsaSAT in LLVM IR. See the sources and the system description submitted at the EDA Challenge for a list of changes compared to IsaSAT in Standard ML.
The main difference compared to the Standard ML version developped in my PhD is that the Isabelle theorem is now incomplete (this was implicit earlier in the sense that it is a limit of the compiler, not a limit of the program) and that the new version is much faster.  … </p>

				<p>As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expand it. The general organization is given by the following graph: . If you want to have a look at the sources, look at the IsaFoL repository (this is the latest bleeding age version, so it is sometimes broken) and the Isabelle-generated HTML documentation (look at the &ldquo;IsaFoL&rdquo; version at the bottom to know the corresponding git ID).  … </p>
