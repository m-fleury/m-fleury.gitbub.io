				<p>This webpage contains documents that I generated, like the Isabelle documentation from my PhD thesis. This is the only way to have links which survives changes in my affiliation.
For my publications, please look here; for my academic duties, please look here.
Research SAT Solver Framework isasatCDCL As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expend it. It is not a very fast SAT solver, but you are guaranteed that the answer is correct and that there is no overflow happening internally that would compromise correctness.  … </p>

				<p>Here the release of my projects that I manage myself (so unlike my changes to, e.g., CaDiCaL).
IsaSAT 2021: EDA Challenge This the first official release of the IsaSAT in LLVM IR. See the sources and the system description submitted at the EDA Challenge for a list of changes compared to IsaSAT in Standard ML.
The main difference compared to the Standard ML version developped in my PhD is that the Isabelle theorem is now incomplete (this was implicit earlier in the sense that it is a limit of the compiler, not a limit of the program) and that the new version is much faster.  … </p>

				<p>As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expand it. The general organization is given by the following graph: . If you want to have a look at the sources, look at the IsaFoL repository (this is the latest bleeding age version, so it is sometimes broken) and the Isabelle-generated HTML documentation (look at the &ldquo;IsaFoL&rdquo; version at the bottom to know the corresponding git ID).  … </p>

				<p>SAT Competition 2022 and v2022-01 The second release is now available. It is the version submitted to the SAT Competition 2022. This year I managed to make IsaSAT work on StarExec.
Compared to the version form the EDA Challenge:
It can now produces DRAT proofs. There are absolutely no guarantees on the correctness of those proofs&hellip; And in particular, I have managed to produce wrong proofs when I forgot to log unit clauses.  … </p>

				<p>While I don&rsquo;t understand much algebra, I know Isabelle and implemented a checker in Isabelle/HOL. I used the Refinement Framework and Sepref to generated code in Standard ML. The code is mostly functional (except for the hashmap that is synthesized automatically by Sepref &ndash; no need to understand and know anything about it!).
How does Pastèque work? I started with an abstract calculus that models the rules of the proofs system.  … </p>
