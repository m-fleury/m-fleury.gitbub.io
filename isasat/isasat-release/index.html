		<div class="post-content"><h2 id="h:2021-eda-challenge">EDA-Challenge 2021</h2>
<p>The first official release is <a href="../../src/isasat/isasat-eda2021-edcd29d.tar.xz">available</a>. It is the version submitted
to the <a href="https://www.eda-ai.org/">EDA-Challenge 2021</a>. To the surprise of everyone (including the
author!), it actually won the challenge. The system description
submitted to the EDA Challenge is <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/papers/Fleury-EDA-Challenge-2021.pdf">available</a>.</p>
<p>How good is the solver really? Another comparison is
the well-known <a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/">SAT Competition</a> that features hard instances with long
running time. The comparison is unfair towards my SAT solver (because
you need inprocessing nowadays to even have a chance for most
instances), but the SAT Competition is the standard way to compare
solvers.</p>
<p>Here is a CDF with kissat (who finished second) and the solver who
finished last during the SAT Competition 2021 (in the plot, higher is better!):</p>

</figure>

<p>(Better <a href="/ox-hugo/sc2021-isasat-kissat-cleanmaple.pdf">PDF</a> version). The conclusion is that IsaSAT would clearly not
have won the SAT Competition 2021, but also would probably not have
been the slowest solver (if I had been able to make IsaSAT work on
Starexec). It is not a great result, but it is an indication how
far you can go without inprocessing.</p>

<p>The conclusion is three-fold. First, it is possible to verify
efficient code in a proof assistant. Second, there is no reason to
believe that verified code is slower than hand-written
one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &ndash; even if it takes much more time to prove
correctness. Third, the perfect SAT solver depends on the benchmarks
you have.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that for verified code targetting
Standard ML, however. Even if MLton is a very impressive compiler for
