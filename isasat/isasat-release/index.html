<p>The second release is now <a href="../../src/isasat/isasat-sc2022-663798f.tar.xz">available</a>. It is the version submitted to
the SAT Competition 2022. This year I managed to make IsaSAT work on
StarExec.</p>
<p>Compared to the version form the EDA Challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can now produces DRAT proofs. There are absolutely no
guarantees on the correctness of those proofs&hellip; And in
particular, I have managed to produce wrong proofs when I forgot
to log unit clauses. This does not matter because the entire
solver is verified, but it is mandatory to take part in the Main
track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have implemented pure literal deletion. IsaSAT search for
literals that do not appear or appear in only one polarity and
sets them to true. It is the first transformation performed by
IsaSAT that does not preserve models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly after the SAT Competition deadline, while drinking tea and
looking at the <a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mfleury/IsaFoL/current/Weidenbach_Book/IsaSAT/">HTML generated documentation</a>, I found two heuristics bugs,
which are solved in the <a href="../../src/isasat/isasat-v2022_01-30966c1.tar.xz">release v2022-01</a>. According to my benchmarks it solves
23 more problems on the benchmarks from the SAT Competition 2021:</p>

<p>(Better <a href="/ox-hugo/sc2021-isasat-schedule-fix.pdf">PDF version</a> of the cactus plot). So, clearly a good fix. I
will probably try to describe to the bug in more details, but in
short: I was restarting way too little and reducing way too much. And
I did not realise that because I swapped it when I printed it during
the statistics.</p>
<h2 id="h:2021-eda-challenge">EDA-Challenge 2021</h2>
<p>The first official release is <a href="../../src/isasat/isasat-eda2021-edcd29d.tar.xz">available</a>. It is the version submitted
to the <a href="https://www.eda-ai.org/">EDA-Challenge 2021</a>. To the surprise of everyone (including the
author!), it actually won the challenge. The system description
submitted to the EDA Challenge is <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/papers/Fleury-EDA-Challenge-2021.pdf">available</a>.</p>
<p>How good is the solver really? Another comparison is
the well-known <a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/">SAT Competition</a> that features hard instances with long
running time. The comparison is unfair towards my SAT solver (because
you need inprocessing nowadays to even have a chance for most
instances), but the SAT Competition is the standard way to compare
solvers.</p>
<p>Here is a CDF with kissat (who finished second) and the solver who
finished last during the SAT Competition 2021 (in the plot, higher is better!):</p>

<p>(Better <a href="/ox-hugo/sc2021-isasat-kissat-cleanmaple.pdf">PDF</a> version). The conclusion is that IsaSAT would clearly not
have won the SAT Competition 2021, but also would probably not have
been the slowest solver (if I had been able to make IsaSAT work on
Starexec). It is not a great result, but it is an indication how
far you can go without inprocessing.</p>

<p>The conclusion is three-fold. First, it is possible to verify
efficient code in a proof assistant. Second, there is no reason to
believe that verified code is slower than hand-written
one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &ndash; even if it takes much more time to prove
correctness. Third, the perfect SAT solver depends on the benchmarks
you have.</p>
