				<p>IsaSAT is one of the few verified SAT solvers (and to my knowledge the only one that is currently maintained). It is verified in Isabelle using the Isabelle Refinement Framework by synthesizing code. See the presentation for more details. </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expand it. The general organization is given by the following graph: SAT Solver Framework I start with an abstract specification of CDCL and prove termination and correctness. CDCL is specified as an abstract transition system. I have developped two variants: one based on Nieuwenhuis et al. and a more concrete one based on Weidenbach&rsquo;s version of CDCL.  … </p>

				<p>EDA-Challenge 2021 The first official release is available. It is the version submitted to the EDA-Challenge 2021. To the surprise of everyone (including the author!), it actually won the challenge. The system description submitted to the EDA Challenge is available.
How good is the solver really? Another comparison is the well-known SAT Competition that features hard instances with long running time. The comparison is unfair towards my SAT solver (because you need inprocessing nowadays to even have a chance for most instances), but the SAT Competition is the standard way to compare solvers.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>This is the detailed story of my Tweet about the used flag.
Database Reduction Some background first. CDCL solvers learns clauses. Actually they generate way too many clauses to keep all of them. So you have to remove them. Actually many of them. This happens during so-called reductions.
This comes from the theory of CDCL. There are two way to keep completeness: either delay restarts more-and-more or keep more-and-more clauses. But this does not tell you which clauses you have to keep during reductions.  … </p>
