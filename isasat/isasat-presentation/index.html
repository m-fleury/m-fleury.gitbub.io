		<div class="post-content"><p>As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT
solving. I still continue to expand it. The general organization is
given by the following graph:
<img src="/ox-hugo/sat_framework.png" alt="">. If you want to have a look at
the sources, look at the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/isafol/isafol/src/master/Weidenbach_Book/">IsaFoL</a> repository (this is the latest
bleeding age version, so it is sometimes broken) and the
<a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mfleury/IsaFoL/current/Weidenbach_Book/">Isabelle-generated HTML documentation</a> (look at the &ldquo;IsaFoL&rdquo; version at
the bottom to know the corresponding git ID).</p>
<h2 id="h:sat-solver-framework">SAT Solver Framework</h2>
<p>I start with an abstract specification of CDCL and prove termination
and correctness. CDCL is specified as an abstract transition system. I
have developped two variants: one based on Nieuwenhuis et al. and a
more concrete one based on Weidenbach&rsquo;s version of CDCL. I show that
the latter version refines (specializes) the former.</p>
<h2 id="h:pcdcl">Pragmatic CDCL</h2>
<p>The PCDCL (standing for pragmatic CDCL) and IsaSAT/LLVM have not yet
been described in a publications, but have already been included in
the Isabelle formalization. It is currently used for very simple
simplifications, namely removing true clauses and (unconditionally)
false literals from clauses. This is very important to do (in
particular because in some problems from the SAT Competition several
thousands units are generated per minute), but this is already beyond
the CDCL framework from my thesis.</p>
<h2 id="h:watched-literals">Watched Literals</h2>
<p>First I developed a transition that includes the watched listeral
(with blocking clauses) optimization to efficiently find propagations and conflicts.</p>
<p>From there one, I enter the <strong>nondeterminism refinement monad</strong>. It is a
way to write nondeterministic programs (like the transition systems),
while still getting closer to programs (e.g., invariants and loops).</p>
<h2 id="h:heuristics">Heuristics and Executable Code</h2>
<p>Now comes the level where the nondeterminstic operations are replaced
by deterministic heuristics. This level is not so important from the
Isabelle point-of-view, but is absolutely critical for performance. It
is very easy to destroy performance by restarting too often (or not
often enough).</p>
<p>Finally I use <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/isabelle_llvm/">Peter Lammich&rsquo;s Isabelle-LLVM</a> to generate code in LLVM&rsquo;s
intermediate language. The code can be compiled with <code>clang</code>. Combined
with a hand-written parser and printer of the output, the code can be
fed with a DIMACS like any other SAT solver.</p>
<p>During my PhD thesis I used the (older) Refinement Framework to generate
Standard ML. This allowed me to prove completeness (for a
powerful-enough compiler and machine), but the code was twice as slow
as the LLVM-generated version (same Isabelle code!) &ndash; and in the end
the completeness guarantees were similar.</p>
<h2 id="h:correctness">Correctness</h2>
<p>In essence, the completeness mentioned in the graph above, means completeness unless
you cannot allocate enough memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Standard ML modelisation of Isabelle, arrays can be
accessed by arbitrary sized integers. However, compilers do not
have to support that.  Therefore, in practice, the memory is
limited to around 2<sup>61</sup> bits (for MLton) to represent the clauses
and their headers. Such machines currently do not exist (and
filling so much memory takes a very long time too).</li>
<li>In LLVM, we are restricted to a certain number of clauses (it must
fit in a 64-bit integer!) and all clauses have fit in array (like
in standard ML with the limit of 2<sup>63</sup> bits). With enough memory
(more than 2<sup>63</sup> bits) and enough time, the answer could become
&ldquo;UNKNOWN&rdquo; (but no overflow will lead to a wrong error!)</li>
</ul>
