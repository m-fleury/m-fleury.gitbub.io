		<div class="post-content"><p>This is the detailed story of my <a href="https://twitter.com/MathiasFleury12/status/1423620596341084162?s=20">Tweet</a> about the used flag.</p>
<h2 id="database-reduction">Database Reduction</h2>
<p>Some background first. CDCLÂ solvers learns clauses. Actually they
generate way too many clauses to keep all of them. So you have to
remove them. Actually many of them. This happens during so-called
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->reductions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This comes from the theory of CDCL. There are two way to keep
completeness: either delay restarts more-and-more or keep
more-and-more clauses. But this does not tell you which clauses you
have to keep during reductions.</p>
<p>The very first question is which clauses do we actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to
keep? So actually you have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep the initial clauses (or the strengthened initial clauses),
called the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->irredundant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> clauses</li>
<li>keep the clauses that are used in the trail (because well, they
are currently used)</li>
<li>the binary clauses for technical reasons (to avoid cleaning the
watch lists after each reduction)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Isabelle code looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-isar" data-lang="isar">OBTAIN can_del WHERE can_del --&gt; not used in trail \&lt;and&gt;
  status = LEARNED \&lt;and&gt;
  length \&lt;noteq&gt; 2;
if can_del
then (*delete it*)
else (*keep it*)
</code></pre><h2 id="the-actual-heuristic">The Actual Heuristic</h2>
<p>The flag <code>can_del</code> indicates that we are allow to delete the code, but
do not have to it.</p>
<p>The critical question is: which ones do you keep in a practical
solver? On the one side, we know that 80\% of the unit propagation are
useless, so there is a high likelyhood that a clause is used only once
or twice. On the other side, in practice, we know that learning is
very important.</p>
<p>How does the code look like? Well the more concrete version says that:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-isar" data-lang="isar">let can_del = not used in trail \&lt;and&gt;
  lbd &gt; MINIMUM_DELETION_LBD \&lt;and&gt;
  status = LEARNED \&lt;and&gt;
  length \&lt;noteq&gt; 2 \&lt;and&gt;
  used &gt; 0;
if can_del
then (*delete it*)
else (*keep it*)
</code></pre><p>This tells us that we fullfill the theoretical conditions but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep clauses of small LBD. This idea was pioneered by Glucose.</li>
<li>keep used clauses. This is newer heuristic. It was in particular
the intuition of Armin Biere and one of the contribution of Mate
Soos et other in <a href="https://meelgroup.github.io/publication/sat19%5Fcball/">CrystalBall</a> (Mate Soos has a much better <a href="https://www.msoos.org/2019/06/crystalball-sat-solving-data-gathering-and-machine-learning/">blog</a>
that I do!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, I use a 2-tier version that is also in Kissat. The used flag
takes 3 values: &lsquo;unused&rsquo; (value 0), &lsquo;used one&rsquo; (value 1, tier 1), and
&lsquo;used twice&rsquo; (value 2, tier 2). Only small clauses can enter tier 2.</p>
<p>Anyway, any clause that was used survives the next reduction phase
independantly of its score. Tier 2 clauses actually survive two
reductions phases before being considered for deletion. Do you see the
bug now in the code above? Indeed, <code>used&gt;0</code> is obviously not the
intended heuristic.</p>
<p>Here is a CDF (keep the solver that finished last during the SAT
Competition 2021, on those benchmarks):</p>

</figure>

<p>So, fixing the heuristic clearly improved performance.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-i-actually-trying-to-do">What was I actually trying to do?</h2>
<p>I was working with a different goal actually, but a performance
improvement is obviously nice.</p>
<p>The old code looked like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-isar" data-lang="isar">sort the indices of all learned clauses
j &lt;- number of clauses to keep
for i = j to end do
  if can_del
  then remove clause at i
  else keep clause at i
</code></pre><p>The new version now is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-isar" data-lang="isar">candidate_clauses &lt;- []
for i = 0 to end do
  if can_del
  then push the clauses to st
  else keep it
sort the indices of candidate_clauses
for i = j to end do
  remove clause at i
</code></pre><p>This should reduce the number of clauses to sort, which is important
time factor. Actually very early I had a list of all clauses
(learned + irredundant) and was sorting that one &ndash; because it was
easier to prove&ndash;, but the generated code was way too slow to be
useful.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is anything to learn to about the mistake, except
that reviewing your own code every once in a while is useful. Isabelle
cannot help us here, because I do not know to write a specification
for such heuristics.</p>
