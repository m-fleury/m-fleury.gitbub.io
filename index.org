This webpage will contain documents that I generated, like the
Isabelle documentation from my PhD thesis. This is the only way to
have links which survives changes in my affiliation.


More to come soon.

* PhD Thesis
My thesis comes with some fancy Isabelle documentation [[https://m-fleury.github.io/thesis/doc/Weidenbach_Book/index.html]] and it would be
too bad for the links to get lost.
