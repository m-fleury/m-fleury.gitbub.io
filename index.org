This webpage will contain documents that I generated, like the
Isabelle documentation from my PhD thesis. This is the only way to
have links which survives changes in my affiliation.


More to come soon.

** SAT Solver Framework  :isasat:CDCL:
As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. The
general organization is given by the following graph:
[[file:figures/sat/sat_framework.png]]

The PCDCL (standing for pragmatic CDCL) and IsaSAT/LLVM have not yet been
described in a publications, but have already been included in the Isabelle
formalization (and currently no inprocessing is done).

In essence, the completeness mentioned in the graph, means completeness unless
you cannot allocate enough memory:
  + In the Standard ML modelisation of Isabelle, arrays can be accessed by
    arbitrary sized integers. However, compilers do not have to support that.
    Therefore, in practice, the memory is limited to around 2^{61} bits to represent the
    clauses and their headers. Such machines currently do not exist (and filling
    so much memory takes a very long time too).
  + In LLVM, we are restricted to a certain number of clauses. With infinite
    memory (more than 2^{63} bits), the answer could become "UNKNOWN" (but
    no overflow will lead to a wrong error!)
** SAT Solving    :SAT:
I work with Armin Biere on SAT solving. One (rather obvious, but never written
down before) result is that the standard minimization algorithm is complete in
the sense that it remove all redundant literals (see more details in our SAT'21
paper). The result comes from a completeness theorem on Horn clauses.

Other interests include:
   + parallel cube-and-conquer SAT solving with the SAT solver [[https://github.com/maximaximal/Paracooba][Paracooba]].
   + normal CDCL with our technique coined *shrinking* that reduces the size of
     learned clauses without increasing their glue. The technique is orthogonal
     to minimization. Shrinking shares the cache used for minimization. 

** Proof Reconstruction
One very useful tool of the interactive theorem prover Isabelle is the
interaction with automatic theorem provers living outside. These tools come in two flavours:
  + Sledgehammer: what facts do I need to prove this goal?
  + The =smt=-tactic: let Isabelle check the proof you found for this goal!

I worked on integrated [[https://verit.loria.fr/][veriT]] into Sledgehammer during my master thesis, but I am
now mostly focusing on the second approach. I have extended the tactic to
include the SMT solver veriT and I am now working on integrating the SMT solver
cvc5 -- and unlike the work to integrate the Z3 in Isabelle by [[https://www21.in.tum.de/~boehmes/][BÃ¶hme]], the
authors of cvc5 (especially [[https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~hbarbosa/][Barbosa]] and Lachnitt) and veriT (especially [[https://schurr.io/about.html][Schurr]])
are helping me to make the proofs nicer and the reconstruction work easier!

In this direction, several people (including me) are attempting to define a
proof format tentatively called Alethe that makes reconstruction easy enough.

* Software   :software:isasat:
See [[./src/sources.org]].
* PhD Thesis  :thesis:
My thesis comes with some fancy Isabelle documentation
[[https://m-fleury.github.io/thesis/doc/Weidenbach_Book/index.html][available here]] and it would be too bad for the
links to get lost. The documentation refers to the =fleury-thesis= branch of IsaFoL available at
[[https://bitbucket.org/isafol/isafol/wiki/Home]]

page might or might not be more up-to-date than this one.

* Other Projects
I work in my free time on Isabelle-emacs available at
https://github.com/m-fleury/isabelle-emacs/. It slightly extends Isabelle's LSP
server (no change is done to Isabelle's kernel nor to Isabelle/jEdit) and make
Isabelle usable for Emacs. If you don't like Isabelle/jEdit or find it unstable
and unusable, this provides an alternative.
