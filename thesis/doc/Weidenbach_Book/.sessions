::CDCL:This session the CDCL calculi (Weidenbach and Nieuwenhuis et al.) and the links between
  both. It also contains a very simple implementation based on lists and two extensions (restart and
  incremental).

  This version is based on the Refinement Framework, to make the two-watched-literals part easier to compile
  (workaround as long as a session cannot have two parents).
  ::CDCL_Extensions:This sessions contains the extensions of the CDCL calculus.::CDCL_no_Sepref:This session is the same as the CDCL session, but des not import
  the Refinement Framework.
  ::Entailment_Definition:This session contains various (but still general) definition of entailment used
  later.::IsaSAT:We here refine the previous session to generate code.::Model_Enumeration:This extends the previous version to a very simple 'SMT' solver: we enumerate all models and let an unspecified theoty solver checks if a model is valid or another must be found.::Normalisation:This session contains the normalisation from general formulas to CNF and DNF.::Resolution_Superposition:This session contains the formalisation of resolution and the beginning of
  superposition.::Watched_Literals:This session contains all theories related to the two-watched literals. It links
    the abstract CDCL calculus to a more concrete version with watched literals.::Weidenbach_Book:We import everything::Weidenbach_Book_Base:This session imports HOL, some additional useful theories from HOL, and our own
  extensions above these lemmas.
