Here the release of my projects that I manage myself (so unlike my changes to, e.g., CaDiCaL).

* <<IsaSAT>>IsaSAT
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isasat
:END:
** 2021: EDA Challenge
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isasat-eda-challenge
:END:
This the first official release of the IsaSAT in LLVM IR. See the
[[./isasat/isasat-eda2021-edcd29d.tar.xz][sources]] and the system description submitted at the EDA Challenge for
a list of changes compared to IsaSAT in Standard ML.

The main difference compared to the Standard ML version developped in
my PhD is that the Isabelle theorem is now incomplete (this was
implicit earlie) and that the new version is much faster.

* <<IsaSAT-ML>>IsaSAT in Standard ML
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isasat-ml
:END:
This is the last version of our IsaSAT sources in Standard ML:
[[./isasat-ML/isasat-ml-last.tar.xz][Sources]]. The compiler MLton is the only compiler we tried that offers
reasonnable performance.

* <<Pasteque>> Pastèque
** Pastèque 2
Pastèque 2 is available on the [[https://bitbucket.org/isafol/isafol/src/master/PAC_Checker2/][IsaFoL repository]] and the HTML
generation can be [[https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mfleury/IsaFoL/current/PAC_Checker2/][seen]] too. The source code can be found [[http://fmv.jku.at/lpac/][here]].
** Pastèque 1
The release is also available [[http://fmv.jku.at/pacheck_pasteque/][here]] with the unverified checker PACheck.
