Here the release of my projects that I manage myself (so unlike my changes to, e.g., CaDiCaL).

* IsaSAT
** 2021: EDA Challenge
This the first official release of the IsaSAT in LLVM IR. See the
[[./isasat/isasat-eda2021-edcd29d.tar.xz][sources]] and the system description submitted at the EDA Challenge for
a list of changes compared to IsaSAT in Standard ML.

The main difference compared to the Standard ML version developped in
my PhD is that the Isabelle theorem is now incomplete (this was
implicit earlie) and that the new version is much faster.

* IsaSAT in Standard ML
This is the last version of our IsaSAT sources in Standard ML:
[[./isasat-ML/isasat-ml-last.tar.xz][Sources]]. The compiler MLton is the only compiler we tried that offers
reasonnable performance.
