				<p>This webpage contains documents that I generated, like the Isabelle documentation from my PhD thesis. This is the only way to have links which survives changes in my affiliation.
Research SAT Solver Framework As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expend it. It is not a very fast SAT solver, but you are guaranteed that the answer is correct and that there is no overflow happening internally that would compromise correctness.  … </p>

				<p>As part of my PhD thesis, I developed a framework to formalize SAT solving. I still continue to expand it. The general organization is given by the following graph: SAT Solver Framework I start with an abstract specification of CDCL and prove termination and correctness. CDCL is specified as an abstract transition system. I have developped two variants: one based on Nieuwenhuis et al. and a more concrete one based on Weidenbach&rsquo;s version of CDCL.  … </p>
